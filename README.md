flexIEC
===========

HTML UI capable of presenting a never ending series of evolutionary objects.

This UI is meant as a glimpse into automated, partially automated, or manual evolutionary process. The display is meant to be adjustable for most domains (where most HTMl is injected by some other source). 

Note that while the UI might be in Javascript/HTML, the actual simulation/evolutionary code can be done in native code. This IEC component is agnostic. Provided API hooks for adding/removing objects, and generating new objects. 

See OptimusLime/win for more details.
